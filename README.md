# [Movie Database Explorer](http://zqgg.hatchboxapp.com/)

### Users want to interact with the [Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and be able to view popular tv shows, search for their favorite shows and view details. Movie Database Explorer provides an intuitive user interface for accomplishing these tasks.

#### This application has been built using Ruby on Rails 5.2 and utilizes 'themoviedb-api' gem. This allowed for a quick prototyping of a full stack application with features such as user authentication, search, and caching using [Redis](https://redis.io/)(a powerful in memory data structure store).

#### Future additions to the application could include:

- Integrating more sections of the Movie Database API
- Adding a front end framework such as React
- Ability for users to leave reviews of shows
- Add Pagination
